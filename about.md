## Sup 😎 

I am currently a sophomore at Harvard studying Applied Mathematics 📝 (with applications to CS) as well as Economics 🐍. My main career interests include finance, consutling, and tech. On campus, I am a member of the Harvard College Consulting Group 💼, Harvard Computing Society, and Harvard Financial Analysts Club. Right now I work as a Displays Intern 🖥 at Hewlett Packard in Cypress, TX (my hometown). My hobbies include investing, writing, photography, and programming 👨🏼‍💻. My latest project is an iOS Food/Exercise tracking app.

Outside of school and work, I'm a big sports guy ⚽ 🏀 🏈 and am passionate about fitness  and weightlifting 💪. I'm also Travis Scott's 🎧 biggest fan .
